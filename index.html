        <p>The amazing duo, Eli Sones and Matthew Halper, are DJ/producers from Los Angeles, CA. Eli and Matthew met in high school and formed Two Friends their senior year. The first four years of this music partnership was long-distance due to each going to different colleges, but since graduation they have both moved back to LA to work on the Two Friends partnership full-time. They describe their music as "songs that are fun and get you dancing and moving, but also hopefully resonate with you on a more emotional level at the same time. They are kind of a melting pot of a lot of different elements and influences."  </p>
